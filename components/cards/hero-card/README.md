The hero card is essentially a `thumbnail-card` that includes some hero elements such as larger text

The main component is `hero-details` which contains an image or icon and headings. 

The `hero-heading` uses scalable fluid type so it will scale based on screen size. 

The `hero-details` component can also be used on its own.

## Theming

The `hero-heading` inherits `t-text-primary` for text color
