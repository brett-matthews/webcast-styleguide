Card Image is a sub-component used in other cards to display the thumbnail image. It could also be used on it's own but there are currently no examples of this.

Currently it will always show at 16:9 ratio but it could easily be extended to show other aspect ratios

You can display content over the Image using a `card-image-overlay` or `card-image-overlay--bottom` which will but a gradient overlay either top or bottom to make sure content in always legible
