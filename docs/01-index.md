## Installation

Include `build/css/style.css` in the head the site.

## Foundation Framework

Many base styles, utilities and compontents (eg. buttons and pagination) import from Foundation Sites. 

## Interactivity

Currently this library does not include any javascript. Some components require interactivity by toggling classes. This will need to be handle seperately.
