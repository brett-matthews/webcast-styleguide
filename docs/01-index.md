title: WebcastTV Component Library
---


## Using these components

Include `build/css/style.css` in the head the site.
Copy and Pasting component views is the only way at the moment

## Foundation Framework

Many base styles, utilities and compontents (eg. buttons and pagination) import from Foundation Sites. 

## Interactivity

Currently this library does not include any javascript. Some components require interactivity by toggling classes. This will need to be handle seperately.
